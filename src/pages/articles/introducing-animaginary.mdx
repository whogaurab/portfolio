Hey there, friends! I'm thrilled to announce the launch of [Easy UI](https://www.easyui.pro/) - a collection of over 50 high-quality, free website templates designed for web designers and developers. These templates are built using React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN-UI, and Framer Motion.

Today, I am super excited to launch the first 3 templates:
